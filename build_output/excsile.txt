Step-by-Step Procedure to Deploy Using the Servers Section in Eclipse

Open the Servers View:

In Eclipse, go to Window > Show View > Other... > Server > Servers > OK. This opens the Servers tab at the bottom of the IDE (if not already visible).


Add a New Server Runtime Environment (if not already set up):

Go to Window > Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments > Add....
Expand Apache > Select "Apache Tomcat v9.0" (or v10.0 if using Jakarta EE; v9.0 is fine for standard Servlet/JSP with Java 11).
Check "Create a new local server" if prompted.
Click Next > Browse to your extracted Tomcat folder (e.g., C:\Tomcat\apache-tomcat-9.0.x) > Finish.


Create a New Server Instance in the Servers View:

In the Servers tab, right-click > New > Server.
Select Apache > Tomcat v9.0 Server (or your version) > Next.
If not already set, browse to the Tomcat installation directory > Next > Finish.
You should now see "Tomcat v9.0 Server at localhost" (or similar) in the Servers tab, with status [Stopped].


Configure the Server (Including Port 8080):

Double-click the server entry in the Servers tab to open the editor.
Under "Server Locations," select "Use Tomcat installation" (this uses your external Tomcat for deployment, similar to dropping WAR in webapps/).
Under "Ports," verify HTTP/1.1 is set to 8080 (default). If there's a conflict (e.g., another app using 8080), change it to an available port, but keep it as 8080 per your request. Save changes (Ctrl+S).
If needed, under "Publishing," select "Automatically publish when resources change" for auto-redeploy on code changes.


Deploy the Project to the Server:

Right-click the server in the Servers tab > Add and Remove....
In the dialog, select your project (HospitalMgmtSystem) from "Available" > Add > Finish. This deploys the project in exploded form (equivalent to unpacking the WAR in webapps/).
Alternatively, right-click your project > Run As > Run on Server > Select the Tomcat server > Next > Ensure the project is added > Finish. This deploys and starts the server if not running.


Start the Server:

Right-click the server in the Servers tab > Start (or Debug for debugging mode).
Watch the Console tab for startup logs. It should show "Server startup in X ms" and no errors. If there are issues (e.g., port conflict), stop the server, adjust ports in the editor, and restart.


Access the Application:

Once started, open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/HospitalMgmtSystem/index.jsp (adjust if you changed the port or context root).
If it's the root app or no index.jsp loads, check Console for errors or verify deployment in the Servers tab (status sh
